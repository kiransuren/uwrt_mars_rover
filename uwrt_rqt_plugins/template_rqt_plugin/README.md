template_rqt_plugin folder contains the (seemingly) bare minimum to get an rqt plugin running with c++. It is taken directly from the ros tutorial, but the tutorial itself is missing a lot of important parts. Some code was found online (made by Lucas Walter) that solves some issues but since it was written in 2016 it did not work with the ros distribution we are using (Melodic Morenia). I solved the rest of the issues and it seems this code is stable.
